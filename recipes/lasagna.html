		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p><strong>lasagna</strong>, pasta dish of Italian origin, made with broad often ruffled noodles and a tomato or white sauce.</p>
		<p><em>Lasagna</em>, in the singular, is a southern Italian variation of what northern Italians call <em>lasagne</em>, in the plural. The name is believed to come from a Latin word for cooking pot, <em>lasanum</em>, though some etymologies trace it to the Greek flatbread called <em>laganon</em>, known in Italy since at least the time of Augustus Caesar (63 bce−14 ce). Lasagna in its modern form, made of a meat sauce much like ragù Bolognese that is layered with noodles and béchamel (<em>besciamella</em> or <em>balsamella</em>) sauce, is believed to have originated in the province of Emilia-Romagna. Variations abound throughout Italy: the lasagna served in Naples, for example, usually contains small meatballs, ricotta and mozzarella cheeses, and sliced hard-boiled eggs, while that served in Genoa uses pesto as its sauce. Some recipes use sausage as well as other types of ground meat; others incorporate mushrooms into the ragù.</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>½ pound ground pork</li>
			<li>½ pound lean ground beef</li>
			<li>½ cup minced onion</li>
			<li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
			<li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
			<li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
			<li>While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
			<li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</li>
