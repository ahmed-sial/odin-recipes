		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Glazed ham is a ham that has been topped with a thick, pourable glaze before baking. The glaze enhances the flavor, keeps the ham moist, and gives it a glossy appearance. Glazed ham is a classic holiday centerpiece, often served with mashed potatoes and glazed carrots.</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 (10 pound) fully-cooked, bone-in ham</li>
			<li>1 ¼ cups packed dark brown sugar</li>
			<li>⅓ cup pineapple juice</li>
			<li>⅓ cup honey, or more to taste</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place ham on a rack set in a roasting pan.</li>
				<li>Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 2 hours.</li>
				<li>While the ham is baking, combine brown sugar, pineapple juice, and 1/3 cup honey in a saucepan. Zest orange into the saucepan, then squeeze in the juice. Add Dijon mustard and ground cloves; whisk mixture over medium-high heat as it comes to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until glaze thickens slightly, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
				<li>Taste glaze and adjust seasonings. Add lemon juice for more tang, or honey to make it sweeter. Set aside.</li>
			</li>
