		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Beef brisket, renowned as one of the best barbecue meats, is a flavorful cut packed with fat and connective tissue, making it perfect for the low, consistent smoke provided by a Traeger. If you're contemplating trying your hand at making your first brisket, this basic info will help you get started.</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 (4 pound) beef brisket</li>
			<li>1 large onion, sliced</li>
			<li>2 (14.5 ounce) cans beef broth</li>
			<li>2 (15 ounce) cans French onion soup</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
			<li>Place a large roasting pan over medium-high heat. Sear brisket, fat-side down first, in the hot pan until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Remove brisket from the pan and set aside.</li>
			<li>Place onion slices into the bottom of the same roasting pan; pour 1 can beef broth, 1 can French onion soup, and 1 can beer over onions. Lay brisket on top; pour remaining beef broth, French onion soup, and beer over brisket. Cover the roasting pan with a lid.</li>
			<li>Bake in the preheated oven for 3 hours. Let brisket stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
			<li>Remove brisket from the roasting pan and wrap tightly in aluminum foil. Pour pan juices and onion into a food storage container and cover tightly with a lid. Refrigerate brisket and pan juices, 8 hours to overnight.
